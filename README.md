## Impact of Project

This project provides valuable insights into the bike share system, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enhancing the user experience. By analyzing the bike share data with Power BI, several key patterns and trends were identified:

1. **Rides by Month and Rider Type**: This analysis helps to understand the seasonal demand and popularity among different rider categories (members vs. casual riders). It enables better resource allocation and promotional strategies during peak months.

2. **Weekday Analysis**: By examining the number of rides on different weekdays, the project highlights the usage patterns and preferences of riders throughout the week. This information is crucial for optimizing bike availability and maintenance schedules.

3. **Peak Time Analysis**: Identifying the peak hours for bike usage assists in ensuring that bikes are available when and where they are needed most, improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

4. **Number of Rides**: The total ride count analysis provides a comprehensive view of the bike share system's usage, aiding in performance evaluation and future planning.

5. **Rider Type and Bike Type**: Analyzing the distribution of rides by rider type (member vs. casual) and bike type (e.g., standard bike, electric bike) helps in understanding rider preferences and potentially expanding or adjusting the bike fleet to better meet demand.


### Primary Problems Addressed

- **Optimization of Bike Availability and Maintenance**: By analyzing peak times, weekday usage, and monthly trends, the project helps in optimizing bike availability and maintenance schedules to ensure bikes are available when and where they are needed most.

- **Understanding Rider Behavior and Preferences**: The analysis of rider types, ride counts, and bike types provides insights into user behavior and preferences, aiding in better service provision and targeted promotional strategies to enhance user satisfaction and system efficiency.


### Dataset Details

The dataset used for this bike share analysis includes the following columns:

- **ride_id**: Unique identifier for each ride.
- **rideable_type**: Type of bike used (e.g., standard bike, electric bike).
- **started_at**: Timestamp indicating when the ride started.
- **ended_at**: Timestamp indicating when the ride ended.
- **start_station_name**: Name of the station where the ride started.
- **start_station_id**: Unique identifier for the start station.
- **end_station_name**: Name of the station where the ride ended.
- **end_station_id**: Unique identifier for the end station.
- **start_lat**: Latitude of the start location.
- **start_lng**: Longitude of the start location.
- **end_lat**: Latitude of the end location.
- **end_lng**: Longitude of the end location.
- **member_casual**: Indicates whether the rider is a member or a casual user.


### Steps Followed

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Gathered bike share data containing ride details such as ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name, start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, and member_casual.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Checked for missing or inconsistent data.
   - Cleaned and formatted data for consistency.
   - Converted date and time fields into appropriate formats for analysis.

3. **Data Import into Power BI**:
   - Imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
   - Ensured that data types were correctly assigned for each column.

4. **Data Modeling**:
   - Established relationships between different columns for meaningful analysis.
   - Created calculated columns and measures as needed for analysis.

5. **Visualization Creation**:
   - Designed and created various visualizations to uncover insights:
     - Number of rides by month and rider type.
     - Weekday analysis to identify trends in bike usage.
     - Peak time analysis to determine the most active hours.
     - Overall number of rides to gauge system usage.
     - Breakdown of rides by rider type and bike type.

6. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Integrated the visualizations into an interactive Power BI dashboard.
   - Added filters and slicers for user-friendly data exploration.

7. **Insights and Reporting**:
   - Analyzed the visualizations to draw actionable insights.
   - Compiled a report summarizing the findings and their implications for bike share operations.

8. **Review and Refinement**:
   - Reviewed the dashboard and report for accuracy and completeness.
   - Made necessary adjustments based on feedback to ensure clarity and usefulness.
